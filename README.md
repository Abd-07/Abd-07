# Hi, I'm Abdulaziz ðŸ‘‹

**I am a 16 year old A-Level student passionate about Computer Science!**

My fascination with technology ignited during my formative years to explore the realm of computers and software from an early age. More specifically, in **primary school**, where I was introduced to computer fundamentals such as **Microsoft Office**.

At the age of 10, I was making simple games using **Scratch**.

At 13, I started to learn **Python**. Thoroughly enjoying this, **I began considering Software Development as a career**. I studied how the computer and the internet work. I immersed myself in understanding core programming principles, such as variables, loops, conditions, and functions. Then I learnt to code **more sophisticated programs**, including a variety of applications such as:

- Calculators
- Notepads
- A Tic-Tac-Toe game

And **more complex games later on**, using the "***Arcade***" library. For example, car racing, flappy bird, or a zombie vs plants clone.

Additionally, I used the "***Django***" framework to make websites, **mastering HTML and CSS** to craft dynamic and visually appealing websites. Reading "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" by Al Sweigart taught me a lot about automation. Mainly to:

- Automate file organization
- Reading/writing files
- Web scraping
- How to work with CSV files
- Automating email sending

Moreover, I immersed myself into algorithmic problem-solving, implementing algorithms like:

- Linear and Binary Search
- Bubble Sort
- Quick Sort

Their purpose is to **organize/sort lists** and dictionaries. Before starting to learn **JavaScript**, I decided to learn **SQL**, understanding its role in managing relational databases and data manipulation.

At 15, my journey into web development evolved further as I started learning **JavaScript**, making interactive web applications ranging from calculators to to-do lists. Subsequently, mastering **React.js** empowered me to **design responsive and intuitive user interfaces**, **enhancing the user experience**.

Proficient in **version control systems**, I leverage **Git** and platforms like ***GitHub*** and ***GitLab*** to manage collaborative projects and track changes effectively.

Currently, my focus lies on evolving my backend skills through **Java development**. Exploring concepts such as **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, inheritance, and various architectural paradigms like **REST API** and **MVC architecture**, **I aim to build robust, reliable, and scalable applications**.

My learning path encompasses essential tools and technologies including **Java Spring Boot**, **Gradle**, **Maven**, and **test-driven development methodologies**.

I am also currently learning about emerging technologies such as **Docker** and **cloud computing (AWS)**, while embracing best practices in **continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines** to ensure efficient software development.
